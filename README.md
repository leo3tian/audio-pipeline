## Overview
This repo builds an audio dataset in three steps:

1) Downloading
2) Processing
3) Uploading

## Development
- Python deps are in `requirements.txt` (used by the Dockerfile).
- `cache_models.py` pre-caches models during the image build.

## Credits
- Emilia Pipe inspiration and related ideas draw from OpenMMLab Amphion and community work.
